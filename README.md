# Dry-skulls-CT-and-STL

## Description
This repogitry provides CT images and STL files of human dry skull specimens.
These specimens were purchased many years ago for research purposes by AIST, Japan.

## How to obtain data
Since data files are too large to upload, only one DICOM image for each part and screenshots of STL files are included in this repository. Please send the following information to the author to obtain more data. We will send data in DVD-R(s).
